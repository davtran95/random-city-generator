# Random City Generator

## Synopsis

Pulls US data from geonames.org and uses that to generate random cities across the US. There is population filtering functionality.

## Code Example

```
## Motivation

A friend asked me to give her names of random cities across the US. I figured, why not make a scipt that can do that?
